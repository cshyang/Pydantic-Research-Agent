AI and machine learning are being integrated into every step of the patient care process — from research to diagnosis, treatment and aftercare. “We are doing research to come up with a way to reduce these complex AI models to simpler tools that could be more easily integrated in clinical care,” she notes. With AI and machine learning, Dr. Jehi hopes to continue pushing this research to the next level by looking at increasingly larger groups of patients.\n",

       "### Notable AI Projects\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the most prominent areas where AI's potential is being explored is in healthcare. AI projects like the ones employed in diagnostic imaging and personalized medicine are revolutionizing medical fields by improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care outcomes. For instance, AI algorithms are being utilized to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRI scans, to detect diseases with higher precision. In drug discovery, AI's capacity to analyze vast data sets allows researchers to identify potential drug candidates more quickly, thereby accelerating the development of new treatments. Additionally, projects focusing on AI's integration in electronic health records seek to enhance healthcare delivery by providing real-time insights into patient data, thus offering customized treatment plans. Such advancements have the potential to transform healthcare systems globally by making them more efficient and effective. Concurrently, AI is being incorporated into wearable technology, enabling continuous health monitoring and proactive management of chronic diseases.\n",

       "### Impact Assessments\n",
       "\n",
       "Impact assessments of AI, particularly within healthcare, underscore significant improvements in operational efficiency, cost savings, and patient outcomes. AI's ability to provide early diagnosis of conditions such as cancer facilitates prompt treatment interventions, enhancing survival rates and quality of life for patients. However, alongside these benefits, concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical implications of AI-driven decisions prompt continuous evaluation and regulation mechanisms. Moreover, the integration of AI in healthcare systems presents opportunities for reshaping workforce dynamics, with AI systems taking over routine tasks, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient-centered care. Nonetheless, ongoing dialogue is required to address how these changes will affect job roles and employment in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, as AI technologies proliferate, considerations on the equitable distribution of AI benefits across different societies are necessary to prevent widening gaps in health disparities.\n",
